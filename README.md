# Unleash the Geek by Amadeus

My solution to the Unleash the Geek contest.

It reached the Silver League.

## Possible improvements

Some improvements that I realized only after the contest was over:

0. By observing changes in "has hole", it is possible to better estimate where a robot dug.
0. By observing if an enemy robot returns to the base after digging at a site, it is possible to guess whether or not it found ore.
